## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ES6 JavaScript


### Continued development

Accessibility remains a priority in the project's development. Recent updates focused on improving screen reader compatibility, and ensuring compliance with web accessibility standards (WCAG). These efforts aim to make the application accessible to users with disabilities, promoting inclusivity and usability for all.

To enhance the application's performance, several optimizations were implemented. This includes efficient data fetching and rendering techniques, minimizing unnecessary reflows and repaints, and optimizing JavaScript functions to handle data manipulation and UI updates more effectively.
